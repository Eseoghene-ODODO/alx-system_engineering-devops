## Configuration management
I will be writing the following scripts to automate my task using puppet:
1. I will create a file in /tmp called school with the following properties
- Permission: 0744
- Owner: www-data
- Group: www-data
- Content: I Love Puppet
2. The second script is going to install flask using pip3
3. Lastly, I will create a manifest that kills a process named killmenow.
